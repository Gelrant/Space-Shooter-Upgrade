# SPACE SHOOTER UPGRADE
This is an upgrade to the Space Shooter Game which is originally designed for Unity game tutorials. I have upgraded the game for BBM423 Game Technologies Laboratory course at Hacettepe University. The game is developed with Unity and C#.
# Description

Space Shooter is a Shoot 'em up type game. The general aim of the shoot 'em up type games is to destroy/avoid the enemy characters surrounding the character in the main shooter role controlled by the player moving in the right, left, up and down (or combination of these directions).

# Initial Design vs Updated Design

Camera is rotated 90 degrees for horizontal movement feeling. (Inspiration from "Space Impact" video game developed for use on Nokia phones)
Different game objects, collectibles, game modes and sound effects/music are added for more enjoyable gameplay.
